Building your data and AI platform can be a significant endeavor. Beyond the business challenges such as formulating compelling business  cases and securing buy-in from all stakeholders, there are also technical hurdles related to designing, implementing, and managing your future data ecosystem. Numerous decisions must be made, including selecting appropriate technologies, determining where to deploy your  platform, and ensuring robust security measures are in place. Despite  recent advancements, we observe a concerning trend towards proprietary  solutions, leading to reduced accessibility, flexibility, and sometimes even compromised security.

## Introducing Unilake
Introducing Unilake, a comprehensive, fully open-source data and AI  platform designed to address every aspect of your organization's  data-driven projects in an integrated and holistic manner. Our platform features an opinionated architecture that simplifies adoption and enables rapid deployment. With cutting-edge technologies and best  practices in areas such as data integration, analysis, productization, sharing, and governance, Unilake empowers businesses to unlock valuable insights from their data estates. Our commitment is to become the go-to open-source data and AI platform accessible to business, research projects and governments of all sizes and budgets.

## For whom?
Unilake is available for any data project, big and small. The technology that Unilake is based on is already in use by large corporations and has proven itself to analyze and manage petabytes of data. Run Unilake on a single machine, multiple machines, on refurbished hardware, new hardware or in the cloud. Whether you are a startup, just starting your data and AI journey or a large corporate that requires strict security rules and compliance, we cater to the needs of both.

## Why open source?
While 15 years ago the technologies that introduced the "Big Data" era were open source, most data platforms offered today are either entirely closed-source or offer limited open-source  components within a predominantly closed-source framework (often referred to as open core, distinct from fully open-source software). While this is the case for today's largest data platform providers, there is a new wave of open source solutions making its introduction which is fueling the next phase of the data and AI transformation. By embracing open source from day one and striving to make Unilake universally accessible, we aspire to realize several key objectives and  beliefs:

### Hosting at your terms
In the ever-growing world of data proliferation both the gathering of data and its use are becoming more and more strategically important. In line of this importance so is the need for data security and its governance. Using an open source platform you can host your data and its compute either locally, in the public cloud of your choosing or in a private cloud. There can be numerous reasons to have this freedom, be it compliance (ever-increasing complexity of rules and regulations), sovereignty ambitions (run Unilake in a fully sovereign data center without risks of foreign interventions), performance reasons (tailor your dataplatform to your needs such as streaming applications) or because there is no cloud available for your use case (maritime or edge applications).

### Adjust, tweak and expand
An open source platform allows for anyone to adjust, tweak and expand its functionalities. Perhaps you have a generic capability in mind which can benefit the masses or a specific feature that can better serve your data ambitions, with an open platform you have the freedom of choice and the freedom to tailor it to your needs. Since data is becoming of strategic importance, why take a wholesale solution for granted? In a world where data and AI platforms are commoditized, what will remain of your edge?

### Transparent auditing and governance
For those seeking assurances that the data platform in use does what it says it does when it comes to security, one can take Unilake's source code and its dependencies to fully analyze its inner workings. We believe that increased transparency also increases security, at a minimum you have the possibility to evaluate the level security when you can read the source code, trust but verify. Can you confidently validate the security claims of your current data platform provider?

### Democratizing data and AI
With growing interest in data and AI solutions, the financial divide separating those capable of harnessing these tools and those unable to match required investments widens. We firmly believe that our data and AI platform should be available for all budgets, fostering greater  opportunities to generate actionable insights. In our view, data platforms shouldn't necessitate exorbitant expenditure; they ought to be readily available for any business to innovate and thrive using their data. 

## The ambition
It is our ambition that Unilake becomes the number one open source data and AI platform, allowing everyone to benefit from their data and enabling AI initiatives that otherwise would have been out of reach. By open sourcing Unilake it is in our believes that we are not only lowering barriers to entry, but also allowing for an acceleration of innovation when it comes to data platform development, design, operation and security.
So check out Unilake, fork it, expand it, and tell us where it contributes and where it falls short. Join us on GitHub, chat (chat.unilake.com), or wherever you like to hang out online. Let's build this future together, one line of code at a time.
